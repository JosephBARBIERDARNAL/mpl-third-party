## PR Summary


<!--
To create a new package yml, make a new file with your package name in the `packages/`
directory with a  yml suffix.  Examples can be seen in the `packages/` directory, but
at the minimum you need to include:

* `name`, the package name
* `repo`, the URL to the package repository
* `section`, the type of package (pick one of the sections on the [3rd-party page](https://matplotlib.org/mpl-third-party/))
* a *very* short `description` field.

Other useful fields are `site`, `pypi_name`, `conda_package` (if different from the name), and `conda_channel` if not *conda-forge*.
